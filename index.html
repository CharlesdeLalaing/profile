    <h2> Telling fun facts </h2>
    <p> Do you know why car tires are black? Well, it's actually quite 
        a funny story. At first, they weren't black at all, they were white !
        That is because the natural color of caoutchouc is white. Car manufactures 
        quickly realized that the natural state of the caoutchouc wasn't solid enough and 
        that the tires needed to be replaced often. They then decided to had pigment of black 
        of carbon. Which gave a more robust tire and a black color to the tire. At first, it was 
        only the border of the tire that was black, the inside stayed white (you might have seen 
        that in old movies with vintage cars). They then came to the conclusion to make the all 
        tire black with the black of carbon, this to give it the best longevity. BUT that's not it... 
        Now, the hardness of the tire isn't coming from the black of carbon anymore, but from another
        substance I forgot the name of. The black of carbon is now only used to give that black color
        to your car's tires. </p>
